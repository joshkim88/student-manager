# student-manager
A student sorting application made with React.js

How to deploy locally:

Step 1: download the student-manager repository
Step 2: cd student-sorter
Step 3: npm install
Step 4: npm start

How to sort:
press the grade button at the table's head

Note about assignment:
Left out getting the lowest scorer per grade because creating a new row for average scores using only React was complicated. Couldn't find any documentation. But I was able to add a row to the table that shows the average of every student.
