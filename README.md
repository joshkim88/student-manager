Description

- A student sorting application made with React.js

Getting Started

-clone the student-manager repository

-cd student-scorer

-npm install

-npm start or yarn start

-localhost:300

-press Grade button to sort the students by their Grade.

Note about assignment

- I wasn't able to figure out a way to get lowest scoring student by grade using just React.js.  Maybe I should've used another framework like Express.  Although, I was able to get the Average score for each student and show it on the student table.
