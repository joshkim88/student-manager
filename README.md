Getting Started

step 1: download student-manager repository
step 2: cd student-scorer
step 3: npm install
step 4: npm start or yarn start

Note about assignment
- I wasn't able to figure out a way to get lowest scoring student by grade using just React.js.  Maybe I should've used another framework like Express.  Although I was able to get the Average score for each student and show it on the student table.
